## About

Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction Analysis project! This repository showcases the implementation of stock price prediction using machine learning techniques. The project's main objective is to predict stock closing prices based on historical data and key indicators using a machine learning approach. The model has achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in predicting future stock prices for various national and international organizations.

## Code

The provided Python code demonstrates the application of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for stock price prediction. The LSTM architecture is well-suited for time series forecasting tasks due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns in sequential data.

It's important to note that the code provided is a part of a broader project. While the code can serve as a learning resource, it is recommended to understand each section thoroughly before execution. Familiarize yourself with the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and evaluation methods employed in the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:


1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You might consider creating a virtual environment to manage dependencies cleanly.
   
2. **Making changes in code** : Please note the number of epochs and batches have been set to the minimum. Feel free to adjust according to your needs and your system's computing power.
    
3. **Run the Code**: Open the provided Python script in your preferred development environment and execute the code. Make sure you have the required dataset accessible for preprocessing.

## Required Packages

Before running the code, make sure you have the following packages installed:

- pandas
- pandas_datareader
- numpy
- sklearn
- keras
- matplotlib

To install these packages in a Jupyter Notebook environment, use the following command in a code cell:

```python
!pip install pandas pandas_datareader numpy scikit-learn keras matplotlib
```

## Recommendations for Users

Before running the code, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Understanding the Code**: Take the time to understand each segment of the code. This foundational knowledge will help you comprehend the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and evaluation techniques.

2. **Data Quality**: The accuracy of stock price predictions heavily relies on the quality of your input data. Ensure that you have accurate historical stock data and any relevant key indicators.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with various hyperparameter values to optimize the LSTM model's performance. This involves adjusting parameters such as the number of LSTM units, dense layer sizes, learning rate, and batch size.

4. **Validation and Testing**: Integrate validation data during the training process to monitor your model's performance and avoid overfitting. Additionally, consider extending the testing period for a more comprehensive evaluation of your model's predictive capabilities.

5. **Understanding the Limitations**: Keep in mind that stock market prediction is a multifaceted challenge influenced by a multitude of factors. While machine learning can provide valuable insights, market behavior is inherently dynamic and cannot be predicted with complete accuracy.

6. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Double-check the RMSE calculation in the code to ensure its accuracy. Accurate evaluation of the model's performance relies on correct implementation.

7. **Enhancing the Model**: Consider implementing dropout layers in the LSTM model to prevent overfitting. Additionally, explore alternative model architectures and feature engineering techniques to potentially improve performance.

8. **Reproducibility**: To ensure reproducibility of results, consider setting random number generator seeds before running the code. This practice ensures consistent outcomes across different runs.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the practical application of machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM networks, for stock market prediction. By engaging with the provided code and adhering to the recommendations, you can gain valuable insights into constructing predictive models for time series data.
